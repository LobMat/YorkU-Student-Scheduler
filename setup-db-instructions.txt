FOR THE TEAM:
The Database setup is now a bit different since to prevent the key just being placed here I stored it in a .env file. It should be posted in the Discord. Just place it in the application directory.

FOR THE TA AND PROF:
By the time the final deliverable comes around, I can simply just post the key in the file it's needed. I might be flagged by GitHib for security but I have no concerns since it's a very small project.
