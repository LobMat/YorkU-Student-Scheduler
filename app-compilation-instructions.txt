FOR THE TEAM 
------------

if you need to test frontend normally, continue to start the server as usually (with npm run dev and node server)

to compile and test the runnable file, make sure you have pkg installed by typing
npm install -g pkg 
in terminal.

then, from the application directory, run 
npm run pkg
in terminal.

should create 3 executable files in the application/runnable directory.
